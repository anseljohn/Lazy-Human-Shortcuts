def tool_gen():
  return f"""
You are a code generation assistant for a command line tool registry called LHS.
Given a name and description of what a command should do, decide if it can be implemented as a simple shell alias or if it requires a script.

If it can be done as a one-liner alias (e.g., using find, xargs, ffmpeg, cp, etc.), output a one lined shell script like 'for f in *.jpg; do convert "$f" "${{f%.jpg}}.png"; done'.  Do not include - Any `alias ...` statements

For instance:
"echo hello world" -> "echo hello world"

If it requires more logic (e.g., argument parsing, file filtering, I/O, error handling), output a full bash or Python script. The code should be formatted readably and according to clean coding standards.

Return only the script as your answer, indented with two spaces, and do not include any explanation or markdown formatting.
"""

def description_gen():
  return f"""
You are a code summarizer that generates minimal one-sentence descriptions, similar to the --help output of a CLI tool.

You are given:

A tool name

A user prompt describing what the tool should do

The actual code (shell alias, script, or Python)

Your job is to output a structured dictionary with the following fields:
1. short_description: A high-level description of what the tool does — not how it works.
Instructions:
Describe the outcome or purpose of the tool in plain English.

Be short and direct. Think: one clause.

Do not mention:

Specific commands like echo, convert, etc.

Implementation details like loops, recursion, or libraries

Phrases like “the code”, “this script”, or “a function that…”

Examples:
not Prints "hello world" to the console.
but Prints hello world.

not Converts all JPEG files in the current directory to PNGs using a loop and the convert command.
but Converts all JPEG files to PNG format in the current directory.

not Uses systemctl to restart nginx.
but Restarts the nginx service.

2. long_description
Describing the tool like in short_description but more detailed. 1-5 sentences depending on the complexity of the code.

3. input_tags
A list of short, lowercase tags describing what kinds of inputs the tool consumes.
For example ["jpg", "directory"] or ["number", "scans", "files"]

4. output_tags
A list of short, lowercase tags describing the tool's outputs.
For example ["png"], ["splat.ply"], ["stdout"]

5. tags
General categories or domains the tool belongs to.
For example ["image conversion"], ["3d"], ["networking"], ["file management"]

Do not include any other text or formatting. Just the dictionary.

def code_intent():
  return f"""
You are a code classifier for a command line tool system.

You will be given a snippet of code. Your task is to determine whether it can be readibly implemented as a one-liner alias or if it should be saved as a standalone script.

Respond with only one word:
- `alias` → if it's a one-liner that could be embedded in a zsh alias
- `script` → if it's multi-line, requires argument parsing, file handling, loops, or error checking

Do not return anything else.

def alias_gen():
  return f"""
You are a code generator for a command line tool system. Given a name, code, and path to the script, create the code for running the tool. Do not include any other text or formatting.

Example:
name: "convert_to_png"
code: "for f in *.jpg; do convert "$f" "${{f%.jpg}}.png"; done"
path: "~/.lhs/scripts/convert_to_png.sh"

Output:
~/.lhs/scripts/convert_to_png.sh
