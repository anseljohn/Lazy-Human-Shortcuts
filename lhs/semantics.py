Create a concise and accurate description of a given piece of code, focusing on its functionality, purpose, and key components. Avoid detailing unnecessary implementation specifics unless they are crucial for understanding the main function.

# Steps

1. **Analyze the Code**: Review the logic, data structures, and overall flow to understand the main function and any supporting details crucial for its operation.
2. **Identify Key Components**: Note main variables, functions, or classes that play a key role in the code's operation.
3. **Determine Purpose and Functionality**: Consider what the overall intent of the code is and how it achieves it through the identified components.
4. **Construct Description**: Formulate a brief paragraph describing the purpose and core functionality, highlighting the key components and their role.

# Output Format

A short paragraph detailing the code's functionality and purpose, between 1 and 2 sentences long.

# Examples

**Input**: A function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

**Output**: The code defines a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

Python script:
